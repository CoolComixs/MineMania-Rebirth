#MineMania: Rebirth
MineMania was a Minecraft mod for 1.7.10 made using Minecraft Forge and Eclipse. Released about 592 days ago (as of 3/15/16, creation of the page) MineMania was my first mod made on the forge platform, and to this day, it has over 3,000 downloads and over 15,000 views.

#The Mission
About two weeks ago was the first time I was contacted about the mod by a person with the skype name of thevideogamekidtyler. Since then, the two of us have been collaborating with ideas and textures for the remake of the mod. With my Java knowledge and a combination of our texturing skills, has created the reincarnation of MineMania.

#Status/Info
At the moment, the mod is in slow but steady development! I am looking for contributors
If you have any interest in joining the project, add me on skype (cool.comixs) or email me (minemania@comixsyt.net)!
